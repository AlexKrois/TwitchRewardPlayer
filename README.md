## 🖥 Setup

1. Set every value in the .env file.

2. In OBS, add a **Browser Source** named like:

```
YTVideo
```
It doesn't matter what you set the name to, you will get asked about the name after.

Also, if you've entered a wrong name you can delete the line REWARD_ID=xxxx in the .env file and you will get asked again.

3. Set the URL to:

```
file:///absolute/path/to/embed.html
```

4. In main.py change the host and port to whatever you need:
```
cl = obs.ReqClient(host="127.0.0.1", port=4444)
```
172.26.32.1 is the default IP if you're on WSL.

The port can be found in OBS (Tools -> Websocket Settings) - should be 4444 by default.

## ▶️ Running the script

Simply run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

If the redemption name has never been entered, the script will ask you for the name. Just paste it in.

---

## 🧪 Example Workflow

Viewer redeems a reward with:

```
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?t=43
```

Script does:

* Extracts video ID: `dQw4w9WgXcQ`
* Gets duration
* Limits playback to ~40 seconds
* Writes an embed iframe to `embed.html`
* Shows the OBS browser source
* Sleeps until video ends
* Clears the file
* Hides the browser source again

No interaction needed on your side.
